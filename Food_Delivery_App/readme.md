- props in react: Its called properties pass to a component for dynamic data. It is like argument to a function ie when we pass some arguments to normal js function , like that we pass props to a react component.
  Eg: <DynamicCard name="xyz" age="23"> in this name and age are props , react wrap those props to a object and will pass to a component as a props like : const DynamicCard = (props) => {} , so here in props we have access to name and age like a object and its properties

- We got data from backend in the form of JSON file
- Config driven UI : config driven UI means lets take an eg to understand -> suppose a food delivery app when someone open their application to a specific location eg: mumbai then some discount corousel showed up , but when the same application open in delhi may be no carousel showed up no discount in delhi at that time , same for color , text , price anything specfic to location or person , time and date change in UI then it is called config driven UI

- join method: eg: const food = ["burger", "pizza", "chinease", "indian"] when i use in line with comma seperated : food.join(',') in UI
- key property: while using map we should mention unique key , beacuse react identify each item uniquely. reson for key is suppose if we do not mention key prop and some new item add to list then react render all the list again, because react does not know which restrant card is new, it not uniquely identify items, it will re rendered all the items again , so if we mention key prop while looping items then react already know previous item and only render the item which is new , same for delete , update
